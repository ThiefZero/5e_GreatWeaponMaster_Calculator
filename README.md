# Great Weapon Master Calculator

## Who is this for?
Dungeons & Dragons 5e players who want to know when to use Great Weapon Master(GWM) efficiently.

## What is this?
This is a calculator to determine whether or not going for the GWM swing is more effective than going for a 
regular attack.
I just put it together because I recently started playing a Barbarian character, and wanted to refresh on 
Golang.

## How do I use this?
You can run GWM from your console/terminal.
or
Have Golang installed and enter `go run *.go`.

## Future Improvements
* Add Great Weapon Fighting to the calculator.
* Add Brutal Critical
* Better invalid input handling.
