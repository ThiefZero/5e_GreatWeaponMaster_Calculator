# Great Weapon Master Calculator

## Who is this for?
Dungeons & Dragons 5e players who want to know when to use Great Weapon Master(GWM) efficiently.

## What is this?
This is a calculator to determine whether or not going for the GWM swing is more effective than going for a 
regular attack.
I just put it together because I recently started playing a Barbarian character, and wanted to refresh on 
Golang.

## How do I use this?
Have Golang installed, then just use `go run GWM.go` in console.
